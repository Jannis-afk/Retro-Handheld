My Current Project to turn an old unused Phone (OnePlus Nord N10) into a Handheld Gaming Console.

All the coding is done in the Arduino IDE, USB protocoll is mostly handeld by the adafruit tiny_usb lib
The Phone Runs Lineage OS with an unlocked kernel for a slight OC, but the performance still isnt the best as the Processor is an fairly old Snapdragon 690

Here is a quick render of the 3D Model.
